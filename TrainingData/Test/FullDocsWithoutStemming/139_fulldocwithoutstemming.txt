Career couples fight over who the trailing spouse .
LifeWire Misti Guertin was a publicist with a full roster of clients and a growing salary when her husband Gary 56 was offered a job managing a luxury resort on a private island in the Caribbean .
My career was just beginning to bloom says the Stuart Florida resident but we both placed more emphasis on Gary career .
Misti 47 was raised to believe that the man career comes first .
So she went taking a token title as of the resort .
But less than a year after their arrival in 2005 a fire ravaged the resort and Gary contract was terminated .
The strain on our relationship was sizable she says .
The couple returned to Florida where Misti went back to work as a publicist and Gary as the general manager of a yacht club and marina .
Her income this year she says will exceed Gary .
It common for couples to place more emphasis on the man career according to a 2007 study of more than married men and women ages .
The researchers from the University of Iowa and the University of also found that when couples relocate the husband tends to get a salary boost $ on average .
But the wife loses $ 750 .
When couples migrate they are typically doing it for the benefit of the husband career and so the wife is what we call the trailing spouse says study author Mary Noonan associate professor of sociology at the University of Iowa .
She may have to take a job in the new location that is a match for her skills or qualifications .
Expert : Things are moving slowly in the right direction .
Why do couples even today let the woman job take a back seat ? .
Blame it on socialization says Noonan .
While it may not be true for every relationship more often than not she says men and women are taught to play very different roles within marriage .
Women are socialized to play a homemaking role within the family whereas men are encouraged to focus on their careers and breadwinning .
See how one dad has taken on duties .
Daniel Buccino a psychotherapist and faculty member at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine agrees .
Until more men are willing to say You know honey you should have to change your name or sacrifice your career and I stay home with our kids and aging parents progress will remain glacial he says .
But things are moving slowly in the right direction .
Making Some Progress After Dayna Steele 48 published her first book in March and began making the media rounds she found herself dealing with subtle power plays at home .
I have tried very hard to schedule around my husband job and keep him posted on my schedule confirming dates before I book them says Steele a former radio host living in Seabrook Texas .
Then he started scheduling things over mine without telling me .
It turned into a battle when I first tried to point out to him what he was doing trivializing my new career after promising to support it because he had a more important job .
Steele knows her husband salary and benefits are important but says her career deserves respect too .
We not quite all the way there but we making some progress she says .
Steele husband Charles Justiz 55 a NASA research pilot says he does his best to show he values his wife career but it can be challenging especially with two children .
We had some collisions he admits .
I ca call NASA and say Excuse me I ca come in because my wife has a book signing .
See how CNN journalists juggle careers with motherhood .
But they both working on being more flexible he says .
I love my wife and the old saying is true : If Mama ai happy ai nobody happy .
Balancing career scales .
Experts have some tips for couples clashing over a career move : Trade places .
It takes some heartfelt conversations to begin balancing the career scales in a marriage says Les Parrott a clinical psychologist and faculty member at Seattle Pacific University .
It requires both spouses to be honest with their feelings .
Parrott asks clients to list what important to them about their careers assigning each element a value from 1 to 10 .
After each spouse makes a list they try to guess how much their partner values each item .
It almost always an says Parrott .
It helps them empathize .
It helps them trade places .
And with that new perspective they are ready for a more honest and exploration of their options together .
Try the package deal approach .
When a couple is considering relocating Buccino says one spouse should see what the new company can do for the other .
Switch off .
Buccino says the fluidity of today job market gives couples opportunities to evaluate and and hopefully switch off between whose career takes priority at various phases along the marital life cycle .
When neither is willing to budge there always the marriage .
I have seen couples that live in two different cities Buccino says because neither is willing to pass up great career opportunities .
While such an arrangement may be a good interim move it can take a toll on the relationship .
Some couples have not made it Buccino says .
If they committed to each other and the relationship and otherwise so busy with work when apart then it can work .
But I not sure I recommend it as a first choice .
