I could stand here and recite the long list of John bipartisan accomplishments Obama said .
Campaign finance reform .
Immigration .
The Patients Bill of Rights .
All those times he has crossed the aisle and risked the ire of his party for the good of his country .
And yet what makes John such a rare and courageous public servant is not the accomplishments themselves but the true motivation behind them .
McCain returned the gracious feelings at the dinner .
I am very grateful to the and to all of you for this very considerate gesture and for allowing me to play a small role in the inauguration of the 44th president of the United States even if it is the one I had in mind a few months ago McCain said .
Tomorrow the will accept the burdensome privilege of leading America to its next accomplishments and its future greatness McCain went on to say .
He has my sincere best wishes for his success and my promise of assistance .
For his success will be our success .
After praising McCain Obama urged everyone to take the bipartisan dinner past just an inaugural tradition and turn it into a new way of doing the people business in this city .
We will not always agree on everything in the months to come and we will have our share of arguments and debates Obama said .
But let us strive always to find that common ground and to defend together those common ideals for it is the only way we can meet the very big and very serious challenges that we face right now .
On the eve of his inauguration the even made time for a joke .
I here tonight to say a few words about an American hero I have come to know very well and admire very much John McCain Obama said as he opened his speech .

The energy on the streets is something I never seen before said Nancy Wigal who lives in Vernon Square .
People are walking lighter standing taller and are reaching out to one another .
It feels like hope .

Everybody got to pitch in .
Wigal said Obama actions and words make her believe the has the skills needed to help the country move forward .
Those of us who live and work here who try to create shape influence and move policy forward are feeling as if we can finally do something that result in forward motion Wigal said .
We believe we have a leader who listens to those who work the issues every day and know the real solutions .
For Wigal that exactly what makes Inauguration Day so important .
Tomorrow is going to be the biggest day in our country history since its creation she said .
During Monday activities Obama also cited the heroics of Airways pilot Chesley Sullenberger who safely landed a crippled commercial airliner in the Hudson River last Thursday saving the lives of all 155 people on board .
If everybody did their job as well as he did his job we would be in pretty good shape Obama said .
Obama has personally invited Sullenberger to the inauguration .

Speaking to the students Obama again invoked King memory noting the slain civil rights leader had dedicated his life to working at the grassroots level on behalf of justice and equality .
I am making a commitment to you as your next president that we are going to make government work Obama said .

If we just waiting around for someone else to do it for us it never gets done .
We going to have to take responsibility all of us .
