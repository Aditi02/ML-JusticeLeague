New search under way for pilot Steve Fossett .
BRIDGEPORT California AP A team of elite athletes and expert mountaineers hopes to do what search planes and satellite imagery could find Steve Fossett body .
The multimillionaire adventurer was declared legally dead in February five months after he was last seen taking off by plane from a remote Nevada ranch owned by hotel magnate Barron Hilton .
The search team led by geologist and adventure racer Simon Donato will focus on remote wooded areas near where the Fossett was last seen areas that could have concealed wreckage from the crews of the many private and military planes that searched last year .
Whether we luck out and find the wreckage or not at least our tracks will be preserved so that in the future if someone wants to give this a try they know where we already were and they can go to the next mountain range over Donato said in a weekend interview at a base camp between the Bodie Hills and Sweetwater Mountains .
The search area with peaks ranging from to more than feet in elevation is just east of the even higher Sierra Nevada and about 110 miles south of Reno Nevada .
Because the area is close to Hilton ranch where Fossett was staying Donato believes it the best place to search .
Search team members who are paying their own way began arriving Friday to set up camp .
The team will continue its efforts through this coming Friday and possibly Saturday covering 15 to 20 miles a day depending on the terrain Donato said .
Previous searchers provided maps and other detailed information on the harsh landscape .
With planes and equipment about square miles was covered from the air .
Some ground searches also were conducted and thousands of amateur volunteers scoured satellite photographs over the Internet of the rugged Nevada landscape where Fossett disappeared .
Donato considers Fossett declared legally dead February 15 by an Illinois judge a hero to many people and dismisses speculation that his disappearance might have been staged .
We here on the premise that he did crash unfortunately he said .
I really respect him .
He has done so much .
Donato 31 wo be the only one looking for Fossett .
In late August Robert Hyman a Washington investor and alpinist plans to bring in a team of up to 15 climbers mountain guides and others with backcountry expertise to check an area just east of the section where Donato will search .
Hyman said he will focus in and around the Wassuk Range dominated by Mount Grant .
When Fossett took off September 3 from Hilton ranch in a borrowed plane on what was supposed to be a short pleasure flight he headed toward Lucky Boy Pass in the Wassuks .
The search area is so rugged that for some a continued search may seem hopeless .
It has on occasion taken decades to find missing people and planes crashed in the area .
Fossett widow Peggy issued a statement saying she not involved in the latest search activity and has no further plans for additional searching .
