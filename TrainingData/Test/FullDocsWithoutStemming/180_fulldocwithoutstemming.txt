Review : Raw emotion fuels new Morissette album .
Entertainment Weekly Once upon a time oh let just call it North America in the mid shall we ? .
Weezer and Alanis Morissette were an inescapable part of the cultural landscape churning out buoyant hits Weezer wordy eccentric anthems Alanis and videos both with impressive consistency .
Each act however have failed to yield quite the success of their initial impact .
So how in the face of a rush of fresh industry blood does an already established act stay relevant ? .
For Morissette the answer on new CD Flavors of Entanglement seems to lie for better or worse in going through a really really bad breakup .

is all over Entanglement thanks to a split with actor fiance Ryan Reynolds .
Granted at 34 she still writes too often in the histrionic style of a feverishly journaling major .
Even so the rawness of her hurt adds heft to screeds like the thunderous Versions of Violence and she found an able partner in producer and Guy Sigsworth a onetime Bj rk collaborator .
His dense swirling compositions seem to push Morissette boundaries conjuring her inner Princess of Darkness on the glitchy gothy Straitjacket and exploring Far Eastern exotica on the opener Citizen of the Planet .
But her most affecting moment may be the most stripped down .
A piano is all the accompaniment needed on the broken fragile ballad Not as We on which her voice cracks heartbreakingly over the lines From scratch begin again but this time I as I\/And not as we .
Somehow a devastating personal experience has galvanized her songwriting in a way that domestic bliss as showcased on 2004 disappointing Chaos could not .
EW Grade : B + .
