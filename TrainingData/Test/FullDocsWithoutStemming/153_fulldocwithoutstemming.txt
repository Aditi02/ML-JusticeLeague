Holder becomes attorney general .
WASHINGTON CNN Eric Holder was sworn in Tuesday as attorney general becoming the first to lead the Department of Justice on a permanent basis .
Vice President Joe Biden administered the oath of office after reading the Justice Department mission statement .
There no mention of politics in that statement .
There no mention of ideology Biden said .
And that as it should be .
Loud cheers and long applause followed Holder taking of the oath .
Nowhere but in this great country could a person like me or the president hope to achieve the positions we are now so fortunate to hold Holder said .
By a vote the Senate on Monday confirmed President Obama nomination of Holder .
Holder 58 is a former federal prosecutor and served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration .
He was briefly acting attorney general in early 2001 .
Holder takes over a Justice Department battered by a series of controversies during the Bush administration from questions about how it laid legal groundwork for harsh interrogations of suspected terrorists to the firings of top federal prosecutors in several cities .
There a big job to do and it going to be Holder duty to turn this department around and restore its credibility said Dianne Feinstein .
During confirmation hearings Republicans questioned his role in former President Bill Clinton widely criticized pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich and questioned whether he would be independent of the White House .
Holder had a testy exchange with the Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Republican Arlen Specter who questioned Holder fitness for the office .
Holder shot back that Specter was getting close to the line in questioning my integrity and Specter ultimately supported the nomination .
But Jim Bunning cited the pardons and what he called Holder insufficient support for gun rights in opposing the nomination .
Holder is supportive of old ideas for gun control that have never made people safer at the expense of taking away their rights Bunning said .
All 21 of the no votes were Republicans but more than a dozen GOP senators joined Democrats in confirming Holder .
Christopher Kit Bond said Holder convinced him he would be looking forward to keeping the nation safe .
Bond the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee raised concerns that the administration would seek to prosecute officials involved in using what the Bush administration called alternative interrogation techniques measures that critics said involved the torture of prisoners in custody .
Holder unambiguously called the use of waterboarding against suspected terrorists a form of torture that violated the Geneva Conventions but he has said that prosecuting intelligence officials who followed Justice Department guidance would be difficult .
Bond said that while Holder answer focused on officials who were following the administration legal advice I told him and I believe he understood that trying to prosecute these lawyers or political leaders would generate a political firestorm .
