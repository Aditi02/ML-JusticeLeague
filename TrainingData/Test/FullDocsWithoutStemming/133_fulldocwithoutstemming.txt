Apple fans mark 25 years of Mac devotion .
CNN Long before fish swam in Macquariums hipsters got Apple logo tattoos and thousands camped out for days to get into computer store openings there was a machine .
Saturday marks the 25th anniversary of the original Macintosh the first personal computer to draw masses introduce the mouse and incorporate a graphical user interface relying on images instead of text .
The Apple watershed product entered American consciousness amid fanfare with a $ million commercial made by Ridley Scott wowing audiences during Super Bowl XVIII .
The piece title 1984 invoked author George Orwell message and stood as a warning against conformity .
Two days after the ad ran the Macintosh became available and life as people knew it changed .
No longer were computers viewed as toys with which to play primitive games or as untouchable tools reserved for degreed engineers .
We began to think different .
The Macintosh demonstrated that it was possible and profitable to create a machine to be used by millions and millions of people said Alex Pang research director for the Institute for the Future a Palo Alto California think tank and chief force behind Making the Macintosh : Technology and Culture in Silicon Valley an online historical exhibit .
The gold standard now for personal electronics is Is it easy enough for my grandmother to use it ? .
People on the Macintosh project were the first people to talk about a product in that way .
Pang 44 remembered being mesmerized by the computer when he first saw it up close in his college bookstore .
He was alone .

For graphic designers like Zo Korstvedt now a Los Angeles creative director the evolving Mac with each added feature was ripe with moments .
To tinker with a piece play with the text to visualize on your computer was just insane she said .
My colleagues and I wonder how we did it their jobs before .
No wonder then that when Korstvedt 44 married her first husband in 1989 she used half of their wedding money to buy her first home computer : a Mac SE\/30 for which she forked over extra bucks for an upgrade to a whopping 8 megabytes of RAM .
Nothing compared to the 12 gigs she now has .
I was styling she said with a laugh .
Jeremy Mehrle 30 of the Louis Missouri area is too young to know a world without Macs .
This MacAddict began hoarding and tinkering with computers and then he discovered eBay .
Today the motion graphics designer basement is a museum to Apple computers and in with about 80 machines on display .
Some people think it really cool .
Others say It Jeremy thing it a little weird whatever he said .
I think if I had stacks everywhere and you could move in my house people would be worried .
What Mehrle hobby however became a career for Dan Foust 38 of Bloomington Illinois .
Danapplemacman as he known on eBay makes a living out of buying and when necessary resuscitating these computers before hawking them online to customers\/collectors in places as as Italy and Australia .
So what would people pay for an original Macintosh ? .
A complete boxed system ? he said .
I ca put a price on that .
The extremes to which people have gone in their love and loyalty for Apple and specifically Macs knows no bounds .
Perhaps no one knows this better than Leander Kahney news editor at and author of Cult of Mac as well as the more recently published Inside Steve Brain .
That would be Apple Steve Jobs brain of course .
From his phone in a San Francisco coffee shop Kahney told tales of people allotting their limited vacation time to Macworld conferences a man who has traveled to 40 Apple store openings and those who shaved Apple logos into their heads .
As for the Apple tattoos those at first really bothered him .
I a bit of a leftie he said .
The idea of corporate worship did initially sit well with him although he not afraid to admit his own obsession .
It a very deep relationship people have with their computers .
If the computer not working it more important than the car breaking down .
Speaking of worship Israeli filmmakers Ron and Kobi Shely created MacHEADS : The Movie a documentary that be available next week on Amazon video on demand service and soon after on iTunes .
The film includes footage from The Church of Mac in Los Angeles where a preacher and congregants gathered to glorify the computer at a service that ended with Praise Steve .
Although we read a lot about the Mac phenomenon Ron Shely said by phone from Tel Aviv of the film project we did realize how big this social movement really is .
And that beyond the products is what has been so powerful about the Mac brand said Peter Friess president of The Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose California .
: Got your own Mac Museum ? .
Show us ! .
Steve Jobs really has changed the world Friess said .
You hardly find people who changed cultures .
He changed culture .
Decades before Jobs health became a topic of discussion Friess was lucky enough to meet the man .
At the time Friess was a lowly watchmaker repairing clocks in the basement of Munich Deutsches Museum the largest science and technology museum in the world .
The year was 1984 and Friess thought a Macintosh might come in handy so he called Apple Germany to see if he might be able to get one .
The answer as he recalled it You very lucky .
Steve Jobs is in town .
We come over and give you one .
Ever since he been amazed and exceedingly intrigued by every new computer .
My wife goes crazy Friess 49 admitted .
Every Apple computer I buy the first thing I do is take it apart just to see what inside .
For Gary Allen 61 of Berkeley California his interest is less inside than it is outside the company stores .
He runs the first three letters taken from his police dispatch days meaning in front of .
The site genesis dates back to 2001 when Apple store No 9 opened in Palo Alto and he and his son went early .
Way early as in the night before .
The crowds and natural community grew on Allen who began seeing friends at other openings .
They were like groupies chasing a band .
So he started a Web site to help fans keep in touch and soon other Apple enthusiasts began writing from across the globe sharing tips about new stores as well as testimonies and photos .
The site he said averages about 4 million visitors a month .
Allen who guessed he been to 22 store openings so far once stood in the rain for days in Tokyo so he could snag the first spot in line .
He seen old friends at openings in Germany and Italy .
Last summer he and his now son experienced what he called the perfect storm hitting Boston Beijing and Sydney .
Next stop : Paris .
He may not speak the same language as the thousands who surround him in these various cities but that does much matter when people speak the same language of computer love .
Apple enthusiasts it turns out Allen said are the same wherever you go .
