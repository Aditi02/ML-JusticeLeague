Winds hamper rescue of stranded Alaska fishing crew .
CNN The Coast Guard on Wednesday was trying to reach the stranded crew of an fishing vessel that ran aground in strong winds in the Bering Sea .
The Icy Mist is taking on water after running aground off the coast of Alaska remote Akutan Island part of the Aleutian Islands according to the Coast Guard .
winds up to 90 mph 145 kph are hampering the rescue operation which involves a Coast Guard cutter and a Hercules aircraft .
The strong winds have delayed the arrival of several helicopters to help rescue the skipper and crew said Petty Officer Walter Shinn a Coast Guard spokesman .
The situation is too dangerous for the to drop a life raft he explained .
They up against the rocky shoreline so it really risky right now to drop survival gear Shinn said .
The water could come and wash them away .
The damaged boat is in danger of breaking up according to the Coast Guard which has had intermittent contact with the stranded vessel .
We are really certain if anyone injured Shinn said .
We do know .
It is unclear if there was an advisory warning ships to avoid the weather which is severe even for the Bering Sea according to Shinn .
The ship owner Bob Gunderson said he was unaware of the situation but was confident that it was his boat .
He said the skipper and three crew members were fishing for Pacific cod .
The Coast Guard received an initial mayday call from the vessel around 4:40 Alaska time 12:40 ET .
