9\/11 billboard draws flak from Florida Democrats GOP .
CNN A Florida man is using billboards with an image of the burning World Trade Center to encourage votes for a Republican presidential candidate drawing criticism for politicizing the 9\/11 attacks .
Please Do Vote for a Democrat reads the type over the picture of the twin towers after hijacked airliners hit them on September 11 2001 .
Mike Meehan a St Cloud Florida businessman who paid to post the billboards in the Orlando area said former President Clinton should have put a stop to Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda before 9\/11 .
He said a Republican president would have done so .
I believe 9\/11 could have been prevented if we had a Republican president at the time Meehan said Wednesday on CNN American Morning .
But Democrats and Republicans are saying Meehan should be using a 9\/11 image to make a political point .
This is a blatant exploitation of that terrible tragedy for political and perhaps even worse personal gain Bill Robinson the Orange County Florida Democratic Party chairman told CNN affiliate in Orlando .
The local Republican Party called the billboard inappropriate according to WFTV .
There are many ways to convey the importance of national security in this election without going to extremes and we encourage a constructive dialogue the Florida Republican Party said in a statement Tuesday .
According to Meehan President Bush has done an excellent job going after these terrorists .
Watch Meehan take on terrorism and the election .
You got to remember all the people that George Bush did catch and how much success he did have .
And we have had an attack on this soil since 9\/11 Meehan said .
Unlike Bill Clinton who actually had bin Laden right in his hand and through the CIA and other high officials decide to get him go Meehan said .
In a 2006 interview with Fox News Sunday Clinton said he authorized the killing of bin Laden in 2000 after the attack on the Navy warship USS Cole in Yemen but the order was never carried out because intelligence and law enforcement agencies refused to certify that bin Laden was behind the Cole attack .
I got closer to killing him than anybody has gotten since Clinton said in the 2006 interview .
Meehan also is using the billboard to promote his Web site the where he trying to sell copies of his song Please Do Vote for a Democrat .
The song goes beyond the national security issue ripping Democrats on taxation and energy issues too .
They want to take the money from the hard workin man and give it to the lazy folks that do give a damn Meehan sings .
Another verse takes on the oil issue .
We not fightin for oil we got plenty if we drill it he sings .
The song not a moneymaker he said just an effort to recoup some of what he invested in the billboards .
A copy of the song on CD cost $ 5 on the Web site and the site points out that Meehan can be hired to perform at a concert party meeting or event .
I willing to pay the cost for the fact that our soldiers that have died protecting this country have paid a heck of a lot more than what these billboards cost Meehan told American Morning .
Florida resident Mary Anderson told WFTV she does see politics when she looking at the billboard .
Just looking at it I not thinking about Democrat or Republican I thinking about the twin towers and all the people killed she told WFTV .
