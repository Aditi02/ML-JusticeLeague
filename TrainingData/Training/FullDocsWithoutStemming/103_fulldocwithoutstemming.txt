Green and Pernice share Sony Open advantage .
CNN Nathan Green of Australia and Tom Pernice Jr share the lead after the second round of the Sony Open in Hawaii .
Taking advantage of an early start and pristine conditions at the Waialae Country Club Green fired his second straight 66 and is on 132 after 36 holes .
Green whose best finish in 90 previous PGA events was second at the Buick Invitational in 2006 had five birdies and one bogey during his second round .
I do think the conditions were as bad as we thought they were going to be he said .
Last night you could hear the wind whipping .
Sort of a stronger version of yesterday .
It did seem anywhere near as strong as they predicted .
Pernice played later in the day and blistered the course for a 63 firing five birdies and an eagle on the 18 .
Obviously conditions like this on a challenging golf course make it a very good round said Pernice .
You not going out thinking you going to shoot .
You just kind of plod your way around and try to hang in there .
The pair hold a edge over leader Shigeki Maruyama who fired a 68 to go with his opening 65 and Brian Gay .
Maruyama is on 133 overall while Gay fired a 67 to go with his 66 .
The greens were a little slower today than they were yesterday Maruyama said .
But I hit the ball well .
I hit some good drives hit some good second shots and hit some good putts .
Zach Johnson is another shot back tied for fifth after a round of 65 .
The 2007 Masters champion had two bogeys five birdies and an eagle on the ninth for a total .
Johnson is level with Webb Simpson on .
Geoff Ogilvy who cruised to a victory at the Championship last week is part of a group on overall .
Ogilvy fired a 69 and is tied with Steve Marino Boo Weekley and Charles Howell III on 135 .
