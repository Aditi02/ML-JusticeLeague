N. Korea preps for satellite launch amid space development claim CNN.com .
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Denying recent intelligence suggesting it is preparing to test a long-range missile North Korea signaled Monday it is gearing up to launch a satellite according to South Korea 's Yonhap news agency .
A senior U.S. official told CNN last week that an American spy satellite had snapped an image of preparations at a North Korean site previously used to launch Taepodong-2 missiles .
The photograph shows North Korea assembling telemetry equipment involving sophisticated electronics used to monitor missile launches the official said adding there was no direct evidence that a missile was being moved to the launch pad .
North Korea 's official Korean Central News Agency -LRB- KCNA -RRB- said Monday it will go ahead with its space development program Yonhap said adding that the report is a possible message to Washington ahead of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's visit to Seoul South Korea this week .
One will come to know later what will be launched in the DPRK -LRB- Democratic People 's Republic of Korea -RRB- KCNA said according to Yonhap but it denied a missile test is planned .
The reclusive North Korean regime made a similar claim after launching a rocket in 1998 saying it succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit Yonhap said .
U.S. intelligence officials initially said after the August 1998 test that North Korea launched a two-stage Taepodong-1 missile but later said it was a three-stage missile and the third stage broke up in an unsuccessful attempt to put a small satellite into orbit .
South Korea rejected the North Korean claim that it has a right to space development with Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan saying at a parliamentary session Whether it is a missile or a satellite -LRB- a launch -RRB- would constitute a violation of the U.N. Security Council 's Resolution 1718 Yonhap reported Monday .
